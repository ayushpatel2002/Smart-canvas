# Smart Canvas: A JavaFX Graphic Design Application

## Overview

Smart Canvas is a desktop-based application that enables users to create various visual content, including posters, cards, and social media graphics, inspired by the functionalities of the popular web-based platform, Canva. This application is developed using Java SE 8 or later and JavaFX, emphasizing the application of object-oriented design principles, design patterns, Java Collections Framework, generics, exceptions, graphical user interfaces, serialization and deserialization, and unit testing.

## Features

### Basic Functional Requirements

- **User Profiles**: Users can create a profile with a unique username, password, first and last name, and a profile photo (with a default option provided).
- **Canvas Creation**: Users can create a new canvas with customizable dimensions.
- **Canvas Editing**: Includes zooming in/out, changing the background color, clearing the canvas, and exporting the canvas as an image.
- **Element Manipulation**: Users can add elements (text, images, circles, rectangles) to the canvas and modify them through moving, rotating, resizing, and deleting.
- **Text Element Customization**: Allows changing text content, font size, type, color, style, alignment, and the text box's border color, width, and background color.
- **Image and Shape Customization**: Users can change images and adjust border and shape colors for circle/rectangle elements.

### Advanced Functional Requirements (Optional)

- **Premium Membership**: Offers access to premium templates and features for a fee, with the ability to subscribe or unsubscribe from the premium service.

## Development and Design

## Documentation

A one-page document analyzing and justifying the design choices made in building this desktop-based application will accompany the project submission. This document will cover the application of the MVC design pattern, adherence to SOLID design principles, and the rationale behind selecting other utilized design patterns.
